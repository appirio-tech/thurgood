**Challenge 2972**
******************
    This challenge requires only that the list of servers be displayed.
    Search, sort and pagination features have been provided.
    Creating and editing a server will be taken as part of challenges 2970 and 2971.

**Files Changed**
*****************
public/js/app.js
    Added route handler for /servers

public/js/controllers.js
    Added controller for the new server list display template

public/js/services.js
    Added new service to cater to the Servers oject. Contains only GET for now.
    Other requests to be taken as part of #2970 and #2971

public/views/directives/navbar.html
    Added link to access the list of servers in the navigation bar

public/views/pages/servers.html
    Added new template to list the servers

The directions to start the application in readme.md still hold good.
No changes to it.

Controller, template and service copied / borrowed from the existing objects for Jobs.
Where appropriate, changes made to suit Servers.

Also, two new functionalities added to the server list display (though not asked for):
1. The "Installed Services" and the "Languages" are arrays that are displayed as string
with the values seperated as commas
2. The status column shows "available" status in green while the "reserved" status is shown in red.
